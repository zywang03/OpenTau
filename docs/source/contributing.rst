How to contribute to OpenTau?
================================

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code
is thus not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping
others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to
the community.

It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the library from blog posts
on the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter when it has
helped you, or simply ⭐️ the repo to say "thank you".

You can contribute in so many ways!
-----------------------------------

Some of the ways you can contribute to OpenTau:

* Fixing outstanding issues with the existing code.
* Implementing new models, datasets or simulation environments.
* Contributing to the examples or to the documentation.
* Submitting issues related to bugs or desired new features.

Following the guides below, feel free to open issues and PRs.

Submitting a new issue or feature request
-----------------------------------------

Do your best to follow these guidelines when submitting an issue or a feature
request. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good
feedback.

Did you find a bug?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenTau library is robust and reliable thanks to the users who notify us of
the problems they encounter. So thank you for reporting an issue.

First, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not
already reported** (use the search bar on Github under Issues).

Did not find it? :( So we can act quickly on it, please follow these steps:

* Include your **OS type and version**, the versions of **Python** and **PyTorch**.
* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in
  less than 30s.
* The full traceback if an exception is raised.
* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.

Do you want a new feature?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A good feature request addresses the following points:

1. Motivation first:

   * Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? If so, please explain
     why. Providing a code snippet that demonstrates the problem is best.
   * Is it related to something you would need for a project? We'd love to hear
     about it!
   * Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community?
     Awesome! Tell us what problem it solved for you.

2. Write a *paragraph* describing the feature.
3. Provide a **code snippet** that demonstrates its future use.
4. In case this is related to a paper, please attach a link.
5. Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.

If your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you
post it.

Submitting a pull request (PR)
------------------------------

Before writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or
issues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are
unsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.

You will need basic ``git`` proficiency to be able to contribute to
OpenTau. ``git`` is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest
manual. Type ``git --help`` in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, `Pro
Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_ is a very good reference.

Follow these steps to start contributing:

1. Fork the `repository <https://github.com/TensorAuto/OpenTau>`_ by
   clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code
   under your GitHub user account.

2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote. The following command
   assumes you have your public SSH key uploaded to GitHub. See the following guide for more
   `information <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/OpenTau.git
      cd OpenTau
      git remote add upstream https://github.com/TensorAuto/OpenTau.git

3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes, and do this for every new PR you work on.

   Start by synchronizing your ``main`` branch with the ``upstream/main`` branch (more details in the `GitHub Docs <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork>`_):

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout main
      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/main

   Once your ``main`` branch is synchronized, create a new branch from it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes

   🚨 **Do not** work on the ``main`` branch.

4. for development, we advise to use a tool like ``uv`` instead of just ``pip`` to easily track our dependencies.
   Follow the instructions to `install uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods>`_ if you don't have it already.
   To develop on OpenTau, you will at least need to install the ``dev`` extras dependencies along with the core library:

   using ``uv``

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv sync --extra dev

   You can also install the project with all its dependencies (including environments):

   using ``uv``

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv sync --all-extras

   To activate the Python virtual environment created by ``uv``, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      source .venv/bin/activate

   Whichever command you chose to install the project (e.g. ``uv sync --all-extras``), you should run it again when pulling code with an updated version of ``pyproject.toml`` and ``uv.lock`` in order to synchronize your virtual environment with the new dependencies.

   The equivalent of ``pip install some-package``, would just be:

   using ``uv``

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv add some-package

   When making changes to the ``pyproject.toml``, you should run the following command to lock dependencies.

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv lock


5. Develop the features on your branch.

   As you work on the features, you should make sure that the test suite
   passes. You should run the tests impacted by your changes like this (see
   below an explanation regarding the environment variable):

   .. code-block:: bash

      pytest tests/<TEST_TO_RUN>.py

6. Follow our style.

   ``OpenTau`` relies on ``ruff`` to format its source code
   consistently. Set up `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to run these checks
   automatically as Git commit hooks.

   Install ``pre-commit`` hooks:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pre-commit install

   You can run these hooks whenever you need on staged files with:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pre-commit

   Once you're happy with your changes, add changed files using ``git add`` and
   make a commit with ``git commit`` to record your changes locally:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add modified_file.py
      git commit

   Note, if you already committed some changes that have a wrong formatting, you can use:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pre-commit run --all-files

   Please write `good commit messages <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_.

   It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original
   repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/main

   Push the changes to your account using:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes

6. Once you are satisfied (**and the checklist below is happy too**), go to the
   webpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on 'Pull request' to send your changes
   to the project maintainers for review.

7. It's ok if maintainers ask you for changes. It happens to core contributors
   too! So everyone can see the changes in the Pull request, work in your local
   branch and push the changes to your fork. They will automatically appear in
   the pull request.


Checklist
~~~~~~~~~

1. The title of your pull request should be a summary of its contribution;
2. If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in
   the pull request description to make sure they are linked (and people
   consulting the issue know you are working on it);
3. To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with ``[WIP]``, or preferably mark
   the PR as a draft PR. These are useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate
   it from PRs ready to be merged;
4. Make sure existing tests pass;

Tests
~~~~~

An extensive test suite is included to test the library behavior and several examples. Library tests can be found in the `tests folder <https://github.com/TensorAuto/OpenTau/tree/main/tests>`_.

We use ``pytest`` in order to run the tests. From the root of the
repository, here's how to run tests with ``pytest`` for the library:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pytest -sv ./tests


You can specify a smaller set of tests in order to test only the feature
you're working on.
