ROS Conversion
==============

This tutorial explains how to convert ROS bags to LeRobot dataset format.

The ROS to LeRobot conversion script is located in ``src/opentau/scripts/convert_ros_to_lerobot.py`` which takes a config file as input. Example config is mentioned in ``configs/examples/ros2lerobot.json``.

The example config looks like:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
    "input_path": <path to ros bag folder>,
    "output_path": <path to lerobot dataset output folder>,
    "fps": <frames per second for the output dataset. The input dataset can be at high frequency like 1000 fps, but the output dataset is at 30 fps>,
    "joint_order": <list of joint names in the order of the state vector>,
    "dataset_features": {
        <feature_name in lerobot dataset>: {
                "ros_topic": <ros topic name stored in rosbag>,
                "topic_attribute":<attribute name stored in ros topic>,
                "enum_values": <enum vales stored in ros topic. Used to parse the field and apply appropriate preprocessing>,
                "dtype":<dtype of the feature in lerobot dataset>,
                "shape":<shape of the feature in lerobot dataset>
            },
        }
    }

The following structure for ros bags should be followed:

<input_path>/
    <bag_name>/
        recording/
            - <bag_file>.mcap
            - metadata.yaml
    <other_bag_name>/
        recording/
            - <bag_file>.mcap
            - metadata.yaml

The metadata.yaml file should contain the task name for the dataset else error will be raised.

The script will process all the bag files in the input path and create a LeRobot dataset in the output path. Each ros bag will be converted to a single episode in the dataset.

Each features should have enum values to parse the field and apply appropriate preprocessing. The function to parse the field is located in ``src/opentau/utils/ros2lerobot.py``.

To add a custom preprocessing, create a new class that inherits from ``FeatureExtractor`` and implement the ``__call__`` method. Generate your own enum type for the feature and map it to the class in the ``EXTRACTORS`` dictionary.
Mention the enum type in the config file for the feature.

Example of enum values for a feature:

.. code-block:: python

    class ImageExtractor(FeatureExtractor):
    def __call__(self, msg: Any, ros_topic: str, attribute: str) -> Any:
        try:
            import io

            from PIL import Image

            image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(msg.data))
            # Convert to numpy array
            image_np = np.array(image)
            # Handle RGBA if necessary, or just ensure RGB
            if image_np.shape[-1] == 4:
                image_np = image_np[..., :3]
            return image_np

        except (KeyError, AttributeError, TypeError, Exception) as e:
            logging.warning(f"Error extracting {attribute} from {ros_topic}: {e}")
            return None

The class should be mapped to the enum values in the config file. and also mapped in the extractors dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    EXTRACTORS = {
        "image": ImageExtractor,
    }


The scripts only supports video dtype for image features.
